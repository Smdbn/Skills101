Task 3: Handling Conflicts

6. Creating Conflicts:

  - In your forked repository, make changes to the same file that you modified in Task 4.

  - Commit the changes.



7. Resolving Conflicts:

  - Create a new branch to resolve the conflict.

  - Resolve the conflict manually in the file.

  - Commit the changes and merge the branch back into `main`.



Task 4: GitHub Pages

8. Enabling GitHub Pages:

  - In your forked repository, create a simple HTML file (`index.html`).

  - Enable GitHub Pages for the repository and set the source branch to `main`.



9. Accessing the Published Page:
